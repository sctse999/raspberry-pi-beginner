Prompt: I want to develop a squat counter using raspberry pi connect with a webcam using Posenet. Write the Pseudocode for this program. 


1. Import required libraries
   - Import PoseNet library
   - Import OpenCV library
   - Import time library
   - Import Raspberry Pi GPIO library (if required)

2. Initialize variables
   - Set squat_counter to 0
   - Set squat_start_flag to False
   - Set squat_end_flag to False
   - Set squat_threshold to a suitable value (e.g., 30 degrees)

3. Setup the Raspberry Pi and webcam
   - Initialize the Raspberry Pi and GPIO pins (if required)
   - Connect and configure the webcam

4. Load PoseNet model
   - Load the pre-trained PoseNet model

5. Create a function to calculate the angle between two points
   - Function calculate_angle(pointA, pointB, pointC)
       - Calculate the angle between points A, B, and C
       - Return the angle

6. Main loop
   - While True
       - Capture a frame from the webcam
       - Pre-process the frame for PoseNet
       - Feed the frame to the PoseNet model and get keypoints
       - Extract the required keypoints (hip, knee, and ankle)
       
       - If keypoints are detected
           - Calculate the angle between hip, knee, and ankle using calculate_angle function
           
           - If angle < squat_threshold and not squat_start_flag
               - Set squat_start_flag to True
               - Set squat_end_flag to False
               
           - If angle > squat_threshold and squat_start_flag and not squat_end_flag
               - Increment squat_counter by 1
               - Set squat_start_flag to False
               - Set squat_end_flag to True

       - Display the frame with keypoints, angle, and squat counter
       - Check for user input to exit the loop (e.g., press 'q' key)

7. Clean up
   - Release the webcam
   - Close the display window
   - Clean up GPIO pins (if required)
